	<h1>About Faelabs and FAQ&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
	
	
	<h2>What happens to the fairies after the experiment?
		</h2>
	<p1>All 6 of our successful fairies produced have been thriving in their built habitats. Researchers have been observing and documenting behaviors, changes and actions of the fairies and so far over the  year observation period no fairy has shown signs of distress.</p1>
	
	
	<h2>Are the fairies intelligent ?
    </h2>
		<p> Although they obtain a humanoid figure, our fairies do not have the type of intelligence we associate with the human brain. As the fairies are composed of both fungi and flower material they have the neural activity of a Psilocybe azurescens including the ability to be aware and respond to the environment , feel pain, and communicate amongst each other. The cell information from the flowers gives the fairies a root and stem system allowing them to absorb light used for energy needed for their flight
			 
	</p>
		<p>Faelabs aims to expand our cell fusion practice to human cells allowing the fairies to have complex intellectual processes. Although this is our ultimate goal at Faelabs, this goal relies on technology we don't yet have.
    </p>
		<h2>Can the fairies be integrated into the environment </h2>
	<p>As the fairies can be grown from any species of flower, the fairies should potentially be able to exist and thrive in the natural habitat these flowers grow in. Currently in the early stage of this process our team has decided to continue observing and documenting the fairies in a lab build environment, whilst testing various replications of natural conditions to observe the fairies ability to adapt and survive in nature. 

</p>
	<h2>Are the fairies safe? </h2>
<p>Absolutely! The fairies do not pose any threat to humans due to their fully natural composition.</p>
	<h2>What is their purpose?</h2>
	<p>As well as being super cool, and demonstrating what science is capable of , Our fairies act as pollinators and in the future may be able to be used to solve the problem of ecological imbalances caused by climate change.As our fairies are made from eukaryotic plant cells found in flowers they have the ability to produce pollen. While we are still observing their flight patterns and flight abilities, our observed evidence strongly indicates that the fairies can maintain flight in a natural ecosystem where they will be able to spread the pollen of their cell fused original flower. Allowing ecologists to strategically deploy our fairies into areas lacking that specific flower. 
</p>
	<h2>Can the fairies reproduce?</h2>
	<p>Both the fungi and flower groups used in this experiment can reproduce asexually. Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction without fusion of gametes or change in the number of chromosomes. The Fungi Psilocybe azurescens used in our experiment reproduces by a process called sporogenesis, all the flowers used in this experiment reproduce through a process called pollination. It was initially hypothesized that when fusing the two cells together the fairies would also be able to asexually reproduce, but due to the completely new structure created when combining cells, our fairies do not have the ability to reproduce. Our fairies do produce pollen of the initial flowers they were made from.
